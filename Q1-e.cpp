=>Efficiiency Class?
This creates a recursion tree with log n levels, and at each level we do O(n) work in the combine step, giving us O(n log n) total time.
=> IS IT A GOOD ALGORITHM FOR THIS PROBLEM????
No. Why??
  for (int i = start; i < middle; i++)
    { // Every number in left half
        for (int j = middle; j < end; j++)
        { // Every number in right half

            if (cross_boundary_distance < currentBest.distance)
            {
                // Found a better pair that crosses the boundary!
                currentBest.distance = cross_boundary_distance;
                currentBest.number1 = numberList[i];
                currentBest.number2 = numberList[j];
            }
        }
    }

This nested loop checks every possible pair where:

One number comes from the left half
One number comes from the right half

If any of these cross-boundary pairs are closer than what we found before, we update our answer.
Why Is This O(n) Work?
In the worst case, if the left half has n/2 numbers and right half has n/2 numbers, we're doing (n/2) × (n/2) = O(n²) comparisons at each level! This is actually inefficient, which is why this approach isn't optimal for the 1D problem.
